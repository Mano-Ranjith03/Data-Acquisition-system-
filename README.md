Designed and implemented a real-time data acquisition system using LPC2129. Interfaced temperature 
and LDR sensors, displayed data on LCD and UART every 1 second using timer interrupts. Integrated RTC 
DS1307 via I2C to show real-time clock and day. Utilized both SPI and I2C protocols for peripheral 
communication.
